title: Implementation Coverage
---

## Overview

---

Reqvire implementation coverage reports show which **system requirements** are implemented and which are still missing implementation evidence.

Implementation coverage is generated by the same command as verification coverage:

```bash
reqvire coverage
reqvire coverage --json
```

The output contains a dedicated **Requirement Implementation Coverage** section.

## Scope

---

Implementation coverage scope includes only:
- `requirement` (system requirements)

Implementation coverage scope excludes:
- `user-requirement`

This keeps stakeholder intent requirements separate from direct implementation tracking.

## Coverage Sources

---

A requirement is considered implementation-covered when at least one of the following is true:

1. `direct_satisfied`
- The requirement has direct `satisfiedBy` relation(s).

2. `refinement_contract_satisfied_via_attachment`
- The requirement owns refinement contracts (`refinedBy`).
- A directly satisfied requirement attaches one of those owned refinement contracts.

3. `refinement_contract_satisfied_via_child`
- The requirement owns refinement contracts (`refinedBy`).
- A derived descendant requirement is directly satisfied.

If none of the above apply, the requirement is reported as uncovered.

## Report Structure

---

Text summary includes:
- Total requirements in scope
- Covered/uncovered counts
- Coverage percentage
- Coverage source counts

JSON summary includes:
- `total_requirements_in_scope`
- `covered_requirements`
- `uncovered_requirements`
- `implementation_coverage_percentage`
- `coverage_sources`

Detailed covered entries include:
- `identifier`
- `name`
- `coverage_source`
- `evidence`

## Notes

---

- This report is about **implementation evidence**, not requirement verification roll-up.
- Verification coverage is documented separately in `docs/verifications.md`.

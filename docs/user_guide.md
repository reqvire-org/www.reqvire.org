## Basic Commands

Reqvire offers several core commands for managing your requirements:

### Help

View the available commands and options:

```bash
reqvire --help
```

### Version

Display the current version:

```bash
reqvire --version
```

## Configuration

Reqvire uses a YAML configuration file to customize its behavior.

### Default Configuration File

By default, Reqvire looks for configuration in the following files (in order):
- `reqvire.yaml`
- `reqvire.yml`
- `.reqvire.yaml`
- `.reqvire.yml`

### Custom Configuration

To use a custom configuration file:

```bash
reqvire -c path/to/custom-config.yaml
```

### Configuration Options

Here's an example of a Reqvire configuration file:

```yaml
  # Path to the user requirements root folder
  user_requirements_root_folder: "specifications"
  
  # Glob patterns to exclude from requirements processing
  excluded_filename_patterns:
    - "Usecases.md"
    - "Logical*.md"
    - "Physical*.md"
    - "TODO.md"
    - "tests/**"
    - "src/**"            

style:
  # Theme for HTML output (default, dark, light)
  theme: "default"
  
  # Maximum width for HTML output
  max_width: 1200
  
  # Optional path to custom CSS file
  # custom_css: "path/to/custom.css"
  
  # Diagram direction (TD for top-down, LR for left-to-right)
  diagram_direction: "LR"
  
  # If diagrams click links should be blobs to work from GitHub console
  diagrams_with_blobs: false  
```

## Working with Requirements

Reqvire is designed to work with a structured requirements hierarchy in Markdown files.

### Folder Structure

A typical Reqvire project structure looks like this:

```
project/
├── specifications/
│   ├── UserRequirements.md
│   ├── MissionRequirements.md
│   ├── SystemRequirements/
│       └── Requirements.md
└── reqvire.yaml
```

### Requirements and general Markdown files format

Read specifications in [SpecificationsRequirements.md](https://github.com/reqvire-org/reqvire/blob/main/specifications/SpecificationsRequirements.md)


## Validation

Any functional require command that needs to parse model will as a first step perform model validation and report any errors found.
Errors must be fixed before command can execute.

## Formatting

Formatting helps maintain consistent formatting and style.

### Run Formatting

Apply automatic fixes to formatting issues:

```bash
reqvire format
```

### Dry Run

Preview formatting changes without applying them:

```bash
reqvire format --dry-run
```

## Traceability

Track relationships between requirements and verifications using traceability features.

### Generate Verification Traces

```bash
reqvire traces
```

This generates upward trace trees from verifications to root requirements, showing how verifications link to requirements and their parent chains. Output is in Markdown format with Mermaid diagrams by default.

#### Output Format Options

```bash
# Generate verification traces in Markdown format with Mermaid diagrams (default)
reqvire traces

# Generate verification traces in JSON format
reqvire traces --json
```

#### Filtering Options

You can filter the verification traces using various criteria:

```bash
# Filter by specific verification ID
reqvire traces --filter-id="test-auth-001"

# Filter by verification name pattern (regex)
reqvire traces --filter-name="Authentication.*"

# Filter by verification type
reqvire traces --filter-type="test-verification"

# Combine multiple filters (AND logic)
reqvire traces --filter-type="test-verification" --filter-name="Login.*" --json
```

Supported verification types: `test-verification`, `analysis-verification`, `inspection-verification`, `demonstration-verification`

#### Relative Link Generation

By default, verification traces generate links relative to the directory where reqvire was executed. You can specify a different base folder for relative links:

```bash
# Generate traces with links relative to a specific folder
reqvire traces --from-folder="docs/specs"

# This makes generated links relative to docs/specs instead of the current directory,
# useful when the output will be placed in a different location
```

### Generate Verification Matrix

```bash
reqvire matrix
```

This generates a traceability matrix showing verification coverage across all requirements.

#### Output Format Options

```bash
# Generate verification matrix in SVG format
reqvire matrix --svg > matrix.svg

# Generate verification matrix in JSON format
reqvire matrix --json
```

The matrix implements the **verification roll-up strategy** - a requirement at any level is marked as verified if ALL its child requirements are verified, with verification status rolling up from leaf requirements through the entire parent chain to the root.

#### Example Verification Matrix

![Verification Traceability Matrix](assets/images/verifications_matrix.png)

*Example traceability matrix showing verification coverage and roll-up strategy. Requirements are color-coded by verification status, with verification rolling up from leaf requirements to parent requirements.*

## Sections Summary

Generate a summary of file sections and their content without individual elements.

### Generate Sections Summary

```bash
reqvire section-summary
```

This generates a summary showing files, sections, and section content without listing individual requirements or verifications.

#### Output Format Options

```bash
# Generate sections summary in text format (default)
reqvire section-summary

# Generate sections summary in JSON format
reqvire section-summary --json
```

#### Filtering Options

You can filter the output using various criteria:

```bash
# Filter by file pattern
reqvire section-summary --filter-file="specifications/*.md"

# Filter by section name pattern
reqvire section-summary --filter-section="System*"

# Filter by content containing specific text
reqvire section-summary --filter-content="MUST"

# Combine multiple filters
reqvire section-summary --filter-file="specifications/*.md" --filter-section="System*" --json
```

## Model Commands

Commands for generating model overviews and summaries.

### Summary

Generate a comprehensive summary of the entire requirements model.

```bash
reqvire summary
```

This generates a summary showing the complete structure of your requirements model, including all files, sections, requirements, and verifications.

#### Output Format Options

```bash
# Generate summary in text format (default)
reqvire summary

# Generate summary in JSON format
reqvire summary --json
```

## Change Impact Report

Generates change impact report comparing current git HEAD with a previous commit.

### Generate Change Impact Report

```bash
reqvire change-impact
```

This generates a report showing how changes affect related requirements. By default, it compares with HEAD~1 (the previous commit).

#### Options

```bash
# Use default comparison with HEAD~1
reqvire change-impact

# Compare with a specific commit (hash or reference)
reqvire change-impact --git-commit=a1b2c3d4

# Output in JSON format for integration with other tools
reqvire change-impact --json
```

## Generating Documentation

Reqvire can export your model to browsable HTML documentation with complete traceability.

### Export to HTML

```bash
reqvire export --output output_folder
```

This creates HTML files with navigation, properly formatted requirements, and interactive diagrams.

### Serve Documentation Locally

For local development and preview, use the serve command to start a local HTTP server:

```bash
reqvire serve
```

This command starts a local server serving your documentation.

#### Command Options

```bash
# Start server on default host and port (localhost:8080)
reqvire serve

# Specify custom host and port
reqvire serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

**Options:**
- `--host <HOST>` - Bind address (default: `localhost`)
- `--port <PORT>` - Server port (default: `8080`)

The server will display the URL and instructions:
- Press `Ctrl-C` to stop the server
- Press `Ctrl-R` in the shell to regenerate and restart the browser

The server continues running until you terminate it with `Ctrl-C`.

## Diagrams

Reqvire can automatically generate diagrams from your requirements model.

### Generate Diagrams

```bash
reqvire generate-diagrams
```

This creates Mermaid diagrams within your requirements files.

### Remove Diagrams

```bash
reqvire remove-diagrams
```

This removes Mermaid diagrams within your requirements files. It is suggested to remove diagrams before using AI/LLM-s to reason about model to reduce context lenght.


## GitHub Integration

Reqvire integrates with GitHub workflows to automate various tasks and provide additional functionality during pull requests and regular development.

### GitHub Actions

Reqvire includes several GitHub Actions workflows that can be used in your repository. You can easily install Reqvire in any GitHub Actions workflow using this oneliner:

```yaml
- name: Install Reqvire
  run: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reqvire-org/reqvire/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

#### PR Validation

The PR validation workflow runs automatically on every pull request to validate your requirements model:

```yaml
name: Validate Requirements on PR

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]  # Trigger on PR creation, updates, and reopening


jobs:
  validate:
    name: Validate Requirements
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Install Reqvire
        run: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reqvire-org/reqvire/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
        
      - name: Validate requirements and generate report
        id: validate
        continue-on-error: true
        run: |
          mkdir -p reports
          reqvire validate | tee reports/validation_report.txt

      - name: Upload Validation Report if validation failed
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:

          git config --global user.name "GitHub Action"
          git config --global user.email "actions@github.com"
      
      - name: Generate Diagrams
        run: |
          reqvire generate-diagrams
      
      - name: Generate verification matrix svg
        run: |
          reqvire matrix --svg > specifications/matrix.svg
                
      - name: Check for Changes
        id: check_changes
        run: |
          if [[ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]]; then
            echo "HAS_CHANGES=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          else
            echo "HAS_CHANGES=false" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          fi
      
      - name: Commit and Push Changes
        if: env.HAS_CHANGES == 'true'
        run: |
          git add -A
          git commit -m "Auto-generate diagrams after PR merge to main"
          git push origin main # Change if needed
```

### GitHub Issue Comment Commands

Reqvire supports command-driven operations through GitHub issue comments. These commands can be used in pull request discussions to trigger specific Reqvire operations.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reqvire-org/reqvire/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This will download and install the latest version of Reqvire for your platform.

### Installing from Source

If you prefer to build from source, you'll need Rust installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reqvire-org/reqvire.git
cd reqvire
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/reqvire`.

### Verify Installation

### Version

Display the current version:

```bash
reqvire --version
```

## File Exclusion Patterns

Reqvire automatically excludes files and directories from structured markdown processing based on ignore patterns defined in:

1. **`.gitignore`** - If your project is a git repository, reqvire reads the `.gitignore` file at the repository root
2. **`.reqvireignore`** - A reqvire-specific ignore file using the same pattern syntax as `.gitignore`
3. **Reserved filenames** - Certain common repository documentation files are always excluded from structured markdown processing

Both ignore files use standard gitignore pattern syntax to exclude files from being parsed as structured markdown (requirements/verifications). However, they differ in an important way:

- **`.gitignore`**: Files matching these patterns are **completely excluded** - they cannot be parsed as structured markdown AND cannot be referenced in file relations to elements
- **`.reqvireignore`**: Files matching these patterns are excluded from structured markdown parsing BUT **can still be referenced** in file relations to elements (useful for design documents, diagrams, or other supporting files that you want to link to but not parse)

### Reserved Filenames

The following filenames are considered reserved and are always excluded from structured markdown processing, as they are typically used for general repository documentation or AI assistant context:

- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `CHANGES.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `LICENSE.md`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `AUTHORS.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `AGENT.md`
- `AI.md`
- `PROMPT.md`
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `CONTEXT.md`
- `CURSOR.md`
- `COPILOT.md`

**Example `.reqvireignore`:**
```
# Exclude use case documents
Usecases.md

# Exclude logical and physical design documents
Logical*.md
Physical*.md

# Exclude TODO lists
TODO.md

# Exclude entire directories
tests/**
src/**
```

## Working with Requirements

Reqvire is designed to work with a structured requirements hierarchy in Markdown files. Requirements are organized using **folders, files, and sections for logical containment** - representing subsystems, features, or functional areas.

### Folder Structure

Reqvire supports flexible organization based on **architectural decomposition** - structuring by subsystem/component rather than by artifact type. Requirements can be organized separately from implementation or co-located with code.

**Example 1: Requirements separate from implementation**

```
project/
├── Requirements.md
├── Authentication/
│   └── Requirements.md           # Authentication subsystem requirements
├── Storage/
│   └── Requirements.md           # Storage subsystem requirements
├── API/
│   └── Requirements.md           # API subsystem requirements
└── src/
    ├── auth.rs
    ├── storage.rs
    └── api.rs
```

**Example 2: Requirements co-located with implementation**

```
project/
├── Requirements.md
└── src/
    ├── authentication/
    │   ├── Requirements.md       # Authentication subsystem requirements
    │   └── auth.rs
    ├── storage/
    │   ├── Requirements.md       # Storage subsystem requirements
    │   └── storage.rs
    └── api/
        ├── Requirements.md       # API subsystem requirements
        └── api.rs
```

Both approaches organize by architectural decomposition. The co-location approach provides additional benefits for developers and AI coding assistants by placing requirements directly alongside the code they describe.

### Model Structure

Markdown files contain **requirements** and **verification elements** that together form the complete model structure. These elements are connected through:

- **Containment**: The folder, file, and section hierarchy provides the containment structure
- **Relations**: Elements are wired together using relations such as:
  - `derivedFrom` - hierarchical relation showing how detailed requirements derive from higher-level ones
  - `verifies` - linking verifications to requirements they verify
  - `trace` - soft relations for traceability between elements

The combination of containment structure and explicit relations creates the full requirements model.

### Requirement Hierarchy Levels

Requirements are organized in hierarchical levels within the markdown structure:

- **Level 1 requirements** are root-level requirements that don't have parent relations. These are typically found at the top level of your main requirements file.
- **Level 2 requirements** (children of level 1) are usually **user requirements** - high-level stakeholder needs and system objectives.
- **Deeper levels** typically contain **system requirements** - detailed technical specifications that derive from and implement the user requirements above them.

This hierarchy naturally reflects the progressive refinement from high-level user needs down to detailed technical implementation.

### Requirements and general Markdown files format

Read specifications in [SpecificationsRequirements.md](https://github.com/reqvire-org/reqvire/blob/main/specifications/SpecificationsRequirements.md)


## Validation

Any functional require command that needs to parse model will as a first step perform model validation and report any errors found.
Errors must be fixed before command can execute.

## Formatting

Formatting helps maintain consistent formatting and style.

### Check Formatting (Dry-Run)

Preview formatting issues without applying changes (safe default):

```bash
reqvire format
```

This shows what would be changed but doesn't apply any fixes.

### Apply Fixes

Apply automatic fixes to formatting issues:

```bash
reqvire format --fix
```

## Linting

The lint command analyzes model quality and detects issues in requirements relations, such as redundant verify relations and potentially redundant hierarchical relations.

### Analyze All Issues

Run lint to detect all model quality issues:

```bash
reqvire lint
```

This analyzes the model and reports all detected issues.

### Filter by Issue Type

```bash
# Show only auto-fixable issues
reqvire lint --fixable

# Show only issues requiring manual review
reqvire lint --auditable
```

### Apply Automatic Fixes

Apply automatic fixes for auto-fixable issues:

```bash
reqvire lint --fix
```

**Note:** Only auto-fixable issues (like redundant verify or redundant direct chain hierarchical relations) will be fixed. Issues marked as requiring manual review (auditable) must be addressed manually.

### JSON Output

Output results in JSON format for integration with other tools:

```bash
reqvire lint --json
```

## Traceability

Track relationships between requirements and verifications using traceability features.

### Generate Verification Traces

```bash
reqvire traces
```

This generates upward trace trees from verifications to root requirements, showing how verifications link to requirements and their parent chains. It also identifies redundant verify relations - cases where the same verification verifies both a leaf requirement and its parent, which indicates the model is not clean. Output is in Markdown format with Mermaid diagrams by default.

#### Output Format Options

```bash
# Generate verification traces in Markdown format with Mermaid diagrams (default)
reqvire traces

# Generate verification traces in JSON format
reqvire traces --json
```

#### Filtering Options

You can filter the verification traces using various criteria:

```bash
# Filter by specific verification ID
reqvire traces --filter-id="test-auth-001"

# Filter by verification name pattern (regex)
reqvire traces --filter-name="Authentication.*"

# Filter by verification type
reqvire traces --filter-type="test-verification"

# Combine multiple filters (AND logic)
reqvire traces --filter-type="test-verification" --filter-name="Login.*" --json
```

Supported verification types: `test-verification`, `analysis-verification`, `inspection-verification`, `demonstration-verification`

#### Relative Link Generation

By default, verification traces generate links relative to the directory where reqvire was executed. You can specify a different base folder for relative links:

```bash
# Generate traces with links relative to a specific folder
reqvire traces --from-folder="docs/specs"

# This makes generated links relative to docs/specs instead of the current directory,
# useful when the output will be placed in a different location
```

#### GitHub Blob Links

```bash
# Generate traces with GitHub blob links (useful for viewing from GitHub)
reqvire traces --links-with-blobs
```

By default, traces use relative links in Mermaid diagrams. Use `--links-with-blobs` to generate diagrams with GitHub blob URLs, which makes clickable links work properly when viewing trace diagrams directly in the GitHub web interface.

### Generate Verification Matrix

```bash
reqvire matrix
```

This generates a traceability matrix showing verification coverage across all requirements.

#### Output Format Options

```bash
# Generate verification matrix in SVG format
reqvire matrix --svg > matrix.svg

# Generate verification matrix in JSON format
reqvire matrix --json
```

The matrix implements the **verification roll-up strategy** - a requirement at any level is marked as verified if ALL its child requirements are verified, with verification status rolling up from leaf requirements through the entire parent chain to the root.

#### Example Verification Matrix

![Verification Traceability Matrix](assets/images/verifications_matrix.png)

*Example traceability matrix showing verification coverage and roll-up strategy. Requirements are color-coded by verification status, with verification rolling up from leaf requirements to parent requirements.*

## Sections Summary

Generate a summary of file sections and their content without individual elements.

### Generate Sections Summary

```bash
reqvire section-summary
```

This generates a summary showing files, sections, and section content without listing individual requirements or verifications.

#### Output Format Options

```bash
# Generate sections summary in text format (default)
reqvire section-summary

# Generate sections summary in JSON format
reqvire section-summary --json
```

#### Filtering Options

You can filter the output using various criteria:

```bash
# Filter by file pattern
reqvire section-summary --filter-file="specifications/*.md"

# Filter by section name pattern
reqvire section-summary --filter-section="System*"

# Filter by content containing specific text
reqvire section-summary --filter-content="MUST"

# Combine multiple filters
reqvire section-summary --filter-file="specifications/*.md" --filter-section="System*" --json
```

## Model Commands

Commands for generating model overviews and summaries.

### Model Diagram

Generate a complete model diagram showing all elements and their relationships.

```bash
reqvire model
```

This generates markdown with a Mermaid diagram showing the complete model structure including all elements and their relations.

#### Filter by Root Element

Generate a filtered diagram showing only elements forward-related from a specific root:

```bash
# Show only elements reachable via forward relations from specified root
reqvire model --root-id=<element-id>
```

This includes only elements that are reachable by following forward relations from the specified root element.

#### Output Format Options

```bash
# Generate model diagram in Markdown with Mermaid (default)
reqvire model

# Generate complete model structure in JSON format
reqvire model --json

# Generate filtered JSON with only forward-related elements from root
reqvire model --root-id=<element-id> --json
```

The JSON output contains the complete model structure including folders, elements, and relations, making it suitable for programmatic analysis and integration with other tools.

### Summary

Generate a comprehensive summary of the entire requirements model.

```bash
reqvire summary
```

This generates a summary showing the complete structure of your requirements model, including all files, sections, requirements, and verifications.

#### Output Format Options

```bash
# Generate summary in text format (default)
reqvire summary

# Generate summary in JSON format
reqvire summary --json
```

## Change Impact Report

Generates change impact report comparing current git HEAD with a previous commit.

### Generate Change Impact Report

```bash
reqvire change-impact
```

This generates a report showing how changes affect related requirements. By default, it compares with HEAD~1 (the previous commit).

#### Options

```bash
# Use default comparison with HEAD~1
reqvire change-impact

# Compare with a specific commit (hash or reference)
reqvire change-impact --git-commit=a1b2c3d4

# Output in JSON format for integration with other tools
reqvire change-impact --json
```

## Generating Documentation

Reqvire can export your model to browsable HTML documentation with complete traceability.

### Export to HTML

```bash
reqvire export --output output_folder
```

This creates HTML files with navigation, properly formatted requirements, interactive diagrams, verification traces, and coverage reports.

### Serve Documentation Locally

For local development and preview, use the serve command to start a local HTTP server:

```bash
reqvire serve
```

This command starts a local server serving your documentation. It's particularly useful for local development and for integrating with AI assistants via Playwright or Puppeteer MCP servers, giving them visual access to your documentation.

#### Command Options

```bash
# Start server on default host and port (localhost:8080)
reqvire serve

# Specify custom host and port
reqvire serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

**Options:**
- `--host <HOST>` - Bind address (default: `localhost`)
- `--port <PORT>` - Server port (default: `8080`)

The server will display the URL. Press `Ctrl-C` to stop the server.

## Diagrams

Reqvire can automatically generate diagrams from your requirements model.

### Generate Diagrams

```bash
reqvire generate-diagrams
```

This creates Mermaid diagrams within your requirements files.

#### Options

```bash
# Generate diagrams with GitHub blob links (useful for viewing from GitHub)
reqvire generate-diagrams --links-with-blobs
```

By default, diagrams use relative links. Use `--links-with-blobs` to generate diagrams with GitHub blob URLs, which makes clickable links work properly when viewing diagrams directly in the GitHub web interface.

### Remove Diagrams

```bash
reqvire remove-diagrams
```

This removes Mermaid diagrams within your requirements files. It is suggested to remove diagrams before using AI tools to reason about model to reduce context length.


## GitHub Integration

Reqvire integrates with GitHub workflows to automate various tasks and provide additional functionality during pull requests and regular development.

### GitHub Actions

Reqvire includes several GitHub Actions workflows that can be used in your repository. You can easily install Reqvire in any GitHub Actions workflow using this oneliner:
